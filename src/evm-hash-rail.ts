// tclk/1 `evm-htlc` settlement rail (SPEC.md §5) — hash-lock only. Binds LockTerms onto
// contracts/EvmHashRail.sol. Point-lock (`t*G == Y`) is a separate rail, out of scope here.
//
// Not part of the main barrel: this is the package's only dependency on an EVM library, kept
// behind the "@flop-labs/tclk/evm-hash-rail" subpath so nothing pulls in viem unless it asks
// to. viem is an optional peerDependency for the same reason.
//
// DID -> chain-address mapping is deliberately NOT part of LockTerms: tclk's DIDs (did:key,
// Ed25519) and an EVM account (secp256k1) are unrelated key material, and the protocol layer
// has no business bridging that. The caller supplies the mapping at construction time, the
// same way PaperRail takes a NoteStore — a rail's external dependencies are its own concern.
